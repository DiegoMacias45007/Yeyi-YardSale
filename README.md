My first attempt of making a full responsive web design page, it lacks JavaScript and Backend, but it's a humble approach
It is an e-commerce approach, regarding a Platzi challenge in its Frontend Developper Course, I made it all by myself, 
without actually following the class in order to test my coding habilities
